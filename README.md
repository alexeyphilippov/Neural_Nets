# Neural_Nets
Here you can find examples of fully connected layers, dropout,  BatchNorm and 2d-convolution. As well as implementation of ResNet and RNNs like LSTM and GRU.

This is a repository with my kernels for Mail.ru course "Neural networks"

Here in notebooks there are implementations of main functions and architechtures, used in NN.
